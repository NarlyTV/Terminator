# pilfer-installer
windows installer for pilfer version 1.4

this is v1.4 of pilfer the replacement for Rip-Record
please note that this release is a beta there will be bugs
and limited funtionality in this release

re written installer  now auto creates environment paths
and desktop shortcuts that will be auto removed if user chooses
to uninstall 

added config tab to gui

you must configure pilfer for your computer
navigate to this tab
and click on configure pilfer 
this is important as  different versions of windows
have different locations for config files 
EG windows 7 and 8 do things differently  to windows 10 


please note this release does not use bash see usage

updated gui

added config file to make mpv player work propperly


fixed error in playercorefactory.xml
added advancedsettings.xml to kodi to fix buffer issues
